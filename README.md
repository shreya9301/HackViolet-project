# Inspiration
<br>
Inspired to encourage women to keep motivated whether they find motivation through work or through relaxation activities such as listening to music, shopping or keeping fit.
<br>
# Features
<br>
The application can basically be divided into two major components that are:
<br>

<b>Relaxation Zone:</b> We also wish to provide a women relaxation space to our website wherein they can just go and choose to find peace whether they want to listen to music or they want to go crazy and shop or they want to know what's going on in beauty industry or they wish to get fit.
